# EMERGENCY QR 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [ Chill_Resting_APIs]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [A B DEVIKA] - [SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGNEERING AND TECHNOLOGY]
- Member 2: [K ARCHISHA NAIR] - [SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGNEERING AND TECHNOLOGY]

### Hosted Project Link
https://aesmer.vercel.app/

### Project Description
A web-based emergency support platform that allows users to:
- Generate an Emergency QR lockscreen
- Share live location instantly
- Access Indian emergency numbers
- View a basic first-aid guide
- Access emotional uplift support
Hosted on Vercel with no backend required.

### The Problem statement
In emergencies, when a person is unconcious, vital medical and contact information is often inaccessable because phones are locked, causing dangerous delay.

### The Solution
We generated an emergency QR code and embeded it into a custom lockscreen wallpaper. Anyone can scan it without unlocking the phone and instantly see medical info and call emergency contact.

UI design: we used HTML and CSS and implemented the responsive layout and used glassmorphism for styling and gradient theme.
structured the safety hub dashboard.
QR generation: collected data for emergency inputs.
lockscreen: QR code overlayed with the wallpaper and downloaded
live location: created a page for live location sharing using geolocation.
addons: added add-ons like positive wall, general first aid and indian helpline contact numbers.
deployement: finally the deployement was done using vercel
